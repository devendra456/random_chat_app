# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
## Random Chat Application

---

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the Random Chat Application, a mobile-based platform that allows users to engage in real-time, anonymous one-on-one conversations with other random users.

#### 1.2 Scope
This application will be developed using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase as the backend service provider. It includes features such as user authentication, real-time messaging, push notifications, and chat session management.

#### 1.3 Intended Audience
- Developers
- QA Engineers
- Project Managers
- UI/UX Designers

#### 1.4 Definitions
- **Flutter**: UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications.
- **Firebase**: Backend platform offering authentication, real-time database, cloud functions, and more.

### 2. Overall Description

#### 2.1 Product Perspective
This is a standalone mobile application not dependent on other software. Firebase services such as Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Messaging will be used.

#### 2.2 Product Functions
- Anonymous chat pairing
- Real-time messaging
- Message delivery status
- Push notifications
- User reporting/blocking
- Simple UI for starting/stopping chats

#### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Guest User**: No login required, temporary anonymous identity.
- **Authenticated User** (optional): Can log in for more persistent sessions and reporting.

#### 2.4 Operating Environment
- Platforms: Android, iOS
- Dependencies: Internet connection, Firebase services

#### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Must use Flutter for frontend
- Must use Firebase for backend
- Scalability within Firebase free tier initially

#### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Firebase services will be available and functional
- Users will have internet access
